# My CKA Exam experience
In this post I'm sharing my exam experience and the resources I used to prepare for it.

The exam gives you 3 hours to complete 24 questions. Actually you have to complete 24 tasks on 6 Kubernetes clusters.
I took the exam on the 1st of December and the clusters were running on 1.11.1 version of Kubernetes.

First of approaching the exam always check the Curriculum Overview and the Candidate Handbook from the following page to see if there is any update.

You should not expect any questions around beta features. If the exam is running on Kubernetes 1.11.1 than you should not expect questions on features that are in beta for that version of Kubernetes.

All the clusters are systemd based.
